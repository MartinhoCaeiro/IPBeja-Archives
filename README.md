# IPBeja Archives

This repository is a personal archive of the coursework, projects, exercises and experiments I completed during my Computer Science studies at IPBeja. It collects assignments, lab work, small apps, scripts and notes—basically all the stuff I did while learning.

## What you'll find here
- Course assignments and lab exercises
- Small projects and prototypes (web, scripts, utilities)
- Notes, experimental code and demos
- Folders organized by subject or project (see each folder's README for details)

## How to use
- Browse the folders to find projects or exercises of interest.
- Many projects include a README inside their folder with usage or run instructions.
- Typical languages/tools used: (see files) — open code files to see exact requirements.

## Notes
- This repo is meant as a personal archive and portfolio of learning. Some code may be experimental, incomplete or used for demonstration/learning purposes.
- If you plan to reuse any code, check individual project READMEs and any included license or attribution.
